# Side by Slide Panel

Side by Slide Panel is a javascript library for easily creating side panels that you can hide/show based on user actions.

The name comes from the method this library uses. In essence, the sidebar is "behind" the main area. Then the main area (not the sidebar) slides to make the sidebar visible.
 
The library is standalone, very small and easy to use.
